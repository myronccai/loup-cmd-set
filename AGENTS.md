# AGENTS.md

This repository recreates the cmd.exe `set` command (list environment
variables, evaluate `set /a` arithmetic) in the Loup programming language,
as part of the loup-cmd series of example applications. The program is `host.dual` Loup
built as a native executable for Linux, with cmd's switch, wildcard, path
and message conventions from the shared Windows code in `source/win/`
(copied from loup-cmd-type).

## Build, run and test

Prerequisites: Loup 1.26.0 (`loup` and `loup-bootstrap` on `PATH`), `make`,
and `clang` 17 or later for native builds.

Loup Lite comes from <https://github.com/code-craft-ai-company/loup-releases>;
[README.md](README.md#installing-loup-lite) has the install commands.

| Task | Command | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Run from source | `make run ARGS="/a 6*7"` | `loup run source/main.loup -- ARGS` |
| Type-check | `make check` | checks `source/main.loup` and every module it imports; tests are not checked |
| Run all tests | `make test` | every `tests/*_test.loup`, one at a time (`--no-parallel`) |
| Run matching tests | `make test TEST_ARGS="--filter wild"` | tests whose name contains `wild` |
| Run one test file | `make test TEST_ARGS="--file tests/win_switches_test.loup"` | |
| Build | `make build` | native binary at `build/set` |
| Run the binary | `build/set /a '(1+2)*3'` | quote `\`, `*`, `?` and `/?` in the shell |
| End-to-end tests | `make e2e` | runs `tests/e2e.sh build/set`: stdout byte for byte, stderr exactly |
| Everything CI runs | `make ci` | check, test, build, e2e, then `build/set --version` |
| Clean | `make clean` | removes `build/`, `.temp/` and `.loup-cache/` |

Run `make ci` before reporting a change as done. `loup run` and the native
build do not support the same things, so a change can pass `make test` and
still fail `make build`.

Do not call `loup test` or `loup check` directly on Linux x86-64. There `loup`
is the self-hosted driver: it refuses `check`, and its test runner cannot
resolve this project's imports. The Makefile uses `loup-bootstrap` (Stage0) for
both, and sets `LOUPPATH=source` for tests. Keep `--no-parallel`: Stage0's
parallel test runner fails these tests at random.

## Making a change

1. Update the spec in `specs/set/` (see
   [specs/README.md](specs/README.md)).
2. Change the code under `source/`.
3. Add or update unit tests in `tests/` and cases in `tests/e2e.sh`.
4. Run `make ci`.
5. Tick the finished tasks in the spec's `tasks.md`.

Keep behaviour in pure functions that return values (`evaluate` returns
the value or the error, `listing` the lines) so unit tests can check it;
only `run_set` prints. The command module is `setcmd` because `set` is a
type name in Loup.

`source/win/` is a copy of the shared Windows code: do not change it here
alone. Improvements go to the master copy in loup-cmd-type and
`ccai-examples/shared/windows/` first.

## Conventions

- Every source file is `@mode(host.dual)` with the `.loup` extension. Only
  `source/main.loup` has a `main()`.
- Modules import each other by path from `source/`:
  `from win.switches import (parse_switches);`. Tests import them the same
  way. Do not use relative imports (`from .args import ...`): the
  self-hosted `loup run` on Linux x86-64 fails on them.
- Windows conventions: switches via `win.switches` (a `/X` that is not
  declared is a path); operands go through `fs_path()` before file access;
  every printed path goes through `display_path()`; messages use Windows'
  wording from `win.messages` or cmd's own; usage errors are ERRORLEVEL 1,
  `set /a` errors cmd's large ERRORLEVELs (Linux shows the low 8 bits).
- Struct fields read from another module must be `pub`.
- The native build supports less than `loup run` does. For example,
  `list.is_empty()` fails native codegen (`E-CODEGEN-UNHANDLED-METHOD`; use
  `len() == 0`), a `sort` comparator that captures a list of structs crashes,
  `system.text.parseInt` does not link, a `match` expression whose arms
  build new strings returns freed memory, and `IoError` cannot be caught:
  check `isFile`/`isDir` before reading.
- Construct a struct only in the module that defines it (layouts disagree
  natively otherwise): `commands/environ.loup` has `env_table`.
- The environment cannot be listed with Loup 1.26.0's library: it is read
  from `/proc/self/environ`. Sort with precomputed upper-case keys: a
  comparator that calls `toUpperCase()` is very costly natively.
- Keep `APP_VERSION` in `source/appinfo.loup` equal to `version` in
  `package.lppkg`.
- The skill's examples use the `loup init` layout (`src/`, `tests/`, and
  `from ..src.x import` in tests). This project uses `source/` and
  `tests/` with plain imports; follow this file.
- The skill documents toolchain 1.25.1; this template targets 1.26.0. When
  they disagree, trust the toolchain's behaviour.
